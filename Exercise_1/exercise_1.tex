\subsection{Create a table of descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset.}
\input{"Exercise_1/OUTPUT/summary.tex"}

The data is made of 217 countries and certain variables contains a significant
amount of missing values (NAs) (See \ref{desc}). Bribery is the worst variable with up to 87 NAs. Using
this variable in a regression would yield a low precision as the size of the sample is quite small.
This table demonstrates how different countries are, indeed the min-max interval is rather close to one for rate variables and the standart deviations (sd)
are very significant compared to the mean value of each variable.

\subsubsection{Is it the case that self-employment is correlated with how rich a country is (in-terms of log GDP per-capita)?}


\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Exercise_1/OUTPUT/emp_wrt_gdp.png}
  \caption{Self employment rate with respect to GDP}
  \label{fig:emp_gdp}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:emp_gdp} shows a clear negative relationship between the share of self employment and gdp. The empirical correlation coefficient is equal to $-0.89$
which is very close to $-1$. The anticorrelation is very strong.
\subsubsection{Is it the case that countries with higher share of employment in agriculture also have higher self-employment rates?}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Exercise_1/OUTPUT/emp_wrt_agro.png}
  \caption{Self employment rate with respect to employment share in the agricultural sector}
  \label{fig:emp_agro}
\end{figure}

As in the previous question, Figure \ref{fig:emp_agro} shows a clear positive relationship between the share of self employment and share of employment in the agricultural sector. The empirical correlation coefficient is equal to $0.91$
which is very close to $1$. The correlation is very strong.

\subsubsection{Present a bar graph comparing the mean self-employment rates in each of these 3 literacy-based categories of countries.}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Exercise_1/OUTPUT/bar_emp_literacy.png}
  \caption{Average self employement rate as a function of the literacy category}
  \label{fig:emp_lit}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:emp_lit} seems to demonstrate a negative relationship between the literacy category of the population and the self employment rate.

\subsection{Estimate the model parameters described using OLS, report your results and summarize them}
\input{"Exercise_1/OUTPUT/results.tex"}
Denoting this linear model as (1) and estimating it yields the results displayed in Table \ref{results_1} (first column).
This OLS estimation was based on only 143 observations, which is far from 217. This raises a
question, are NAs equally distributed across the sample ? That being aknowledged, this regression seems
to be very significant. The overall significance is very high as the F-stat demonstrates.
Every of the three coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 1\% level.
The sign of the variables is in line with the previous discussion in question 1.1.
According to this estimation, a 1\% increase in GDP corresponds to a 6.5\% decrease in the share of self employement.
A 1\% increase in the literacy rate is associated with a 0.3\% decrease in the dependent variable, while a 0.59\% increase in self employment shares 
can be explained by a 1\% increase in the share of the agricultural sector.

\subsection{Describe how you could estimate $\beta_3$ using a 3-step procedure based on the Frisch-Waugh Theorem.}
The Frisch-Waugh theorem can be used for estimating specific coefficients in a multiple regression model while controlling for other variables. Here are the simplified three steps:


\textbf{Step 1:}\\
Identify control variables, here log\_gdp and literacy and regress it on the dependent variable to get the residuals $\hat{r}$.
\begin{equation*}
  \text{self\_emp} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 log\_gdp + \alpha_2 literacy + r 
\end{equation*}
\textbf{Step 2:}\\
Regress the variable of interest on the control variables and get the residuals $\hat{u}$.
\begin{equation*}
  \text{agro\_emp} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 log\_gdp + \gamma_2 literacy + u 
\end{equation*}
\textbf{Step 3:}\\
Regress $\hat{r}$ on $\hat{u}$ and get the coefficient of interest $\beta_3$.
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{r} = \beta_0 + \beta_3 \hat{u} + \epsilon
\end{equation*}
The coefficient $\beta_3$ is the estimate of the parameter for agro\_emp after controlling for log\_gdp and literacy.
