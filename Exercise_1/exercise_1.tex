  \caption{Self employment rate with respect to GDP}
  \label{fig:emp_gdp}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:emp_gdp} shows a clear negative relationship between the share of self employment and gdp. The empirical correlation coefficient is equal to $-0.89$
which is very close to $-1$. The anticorrelation is very strong.

  \caption{Self employment rate with respect to employment share in the agricultural sector}
  \label{fig:emp_agro}
\end{figure}

As in the previous question, Figure \ref{fig:emp_agro} shows a clear positive relationship between the share of self employment and share of employment in the agricultural sector. The empirical correlation coefficient is equal to $0.91$
which is very close to $1$. The correlation is very strong.

\subsubsection*{(c)}

  \caption{Average self employement rate as a function of the literacy category}
  \label{fig:emp_lit}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:emp_lit} seems to demonstrate a negative relationship between the literacy category of the population and the self employment rate.
